# Case Study 01 - Breast Cancer Classification :

Breast cancer is very big problem in women, data shoes that 2.1 Million of women having breast cancer in 2015.      
With 79% of accuracy type breast cancer is detected by physicians & in Machine Learning this figures ranges around 90% (91- 97)%.                

There are 2 types of tumers in breast cancer which are..   

    1.Malignant(Spreads at faster rate in body)      
    2.Benign(does not spreads faster in body)                 

The Benign Means to the Non-Presence of cancer in the patient. We will use SVM-classifier to classify the type of cancer.       

## Problem Statement :
Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features

### Accuracy :

We conclude that the Machine leaning model is able to classify tumers into Malignant and Benign with 96% of accuracy.
