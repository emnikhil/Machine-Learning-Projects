# Problem Statement :

Breast cancer is very big problem in women, data shoes that 2.1 Million of women having breast cancer in 2015. With 79% of accuracy type breast cancer is detected by physicians & in Machine Learning this figures ranges around 90% (91- 97)%.                

There are 2 types of tumers in breast cancer which are..                
    1.Malignant(Spreads at faster rate in body      
    2.Benign(does not spreads faster in body)                 

The Benign Means to the Non-Presence of cancer in the patient. We will use SVM-classifier to classify the type of cancer.       
We use different features of tumer such as RADIUS, TEXTURE, PERIMETER, AREA, SMOOTHNESS
